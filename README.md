## Project Description

Utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an engaging front-end interface. On the back end, employed Express.js in the Node.js runtime, ensuring efficient data handling and a seamless user experience. This project has been developed to support a local Chinese community in Manchester.

As I progress in my Software Engineering journey, I plan to make some modifications. Stay updated!
